= Administer the container

Switch back to the `+Podman+` tab. Exit the containerâ€™s shell

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
exit
----

When the process on an interactive container is closed, the container
stops running. You can verify this by looking at the list of container
processes:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
podman ps -a
----

.Output
[source,text]
----
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                        COMMAND   CREATED     STATUS                   PORTS  NAMES
df54b664f133   localhost/rhel9-httpd:latest /bin/bash 2 hours ago Exited (0) 5 seconds ago        heuristic_cray
----

Notice the __STATUS__ field is now reported as Exited.

.Stopped Container

NOTE: A container in this state can be resumed, however, in this case it will no longer be used.

Typically you can remove a single container from a system using the below command structure.

.Example
[source,text]
----
podman rm <CONTAINER ID>
----

For this training we will use bash scripting to determine the CONTAINER ID as it is unique to each container image.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
podman rm $(podman ps -a | grep Exited | cut -d" " -f1)
----

The output of this removal is the full CONTAINER ID which was removed from the system.
