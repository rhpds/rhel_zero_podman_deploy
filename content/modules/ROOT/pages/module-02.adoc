= Deploy a container image into an interactive container runtime

The *rhel9-httpd* container includes a bash shell. In this step, you
will deploy the container in an interactive fashion, which will allow
you to run commands within the deployed container. In the `+Podman+` tab
run the following:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
podman run -it rhel9-httpd /bin/bash
----

You should now be looking at a generic bash shell prompt:

.Output
[source,text]
----
bash-5.1#
----


In the `Podman` tab, the displayed shell is running inside the container image, not the host operating system.  To confirm this, take a look at the mounted filesystems:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
df -hP
----

.Output
[source,text]
----
bash-5.1$ df -hP
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
overlay          49G  3.5G   46G   8% /
tmpfs            64M     0   64M   0% /dev
tmpfs           719M   13M  707M   2% /etc/hosts
shm              63M     0   63M   0% /dev/shm
devtmpfs        4.0M     0  4.0M   0% /proc/keys
----

You will notice that all of the filesystem contents are either memory-based (tmpfs, shm) or the overlay file associated with this runtime of the container image (overlay).

Switch to the `RHEL Host` tab. Use this terminal to verify that the container is running:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
podman ps -a
----

.RHEL Host
image::rhelhostpsa.png[RHEL Host]

*Note:* Your CONTAINER ID and NAMES will be different than the output
displayed above as each container is assigned a unique ID and Name.
