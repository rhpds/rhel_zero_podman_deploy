When the process on an interactive container is closed, the container
stops running. You can verify this by looking at the list of container
processes:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
podman ps -a

.Stopped Container
image::stopped-container.png[Stopped Container]

Notice the __STATUS__ field is now reported as Exited.

A container in this state can be resumed, however, this one will no longer be used.  You will remove it from the system. using __podman rm <CONTAINER ID>__.  In the command below, we use a bit of bash scripting to determine the CONTAINER ID as it is unique to each container image.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
podman rm $(podman ps -a | grep Exited | cut -d" " -f1)
----

The output of this removal is the full CONTAINER ID which was removed
from the system.
