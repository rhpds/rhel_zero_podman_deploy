The *rhel9-httpd* container includes a bash shell. In this step, you
will deploy the container in an interactive fashion, which will allow
you to run commands within the deployed container. In the `+Podman+` tab
run the following:

[source,bash]
----
podman run -it rhel9-httpd /bin/bash
----

You should now be looking at a generic bash shell prompt:

bash-5.1#

....

In the `Podman` tab, the displayed shell is running inside the container image, not the host operating system.  To confirm this, take a look at the mounted filesystems:

```bash
df -hP
....

Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on overlay 35G 6.1G 30G 36% /
tmpfs 64M 0 64M 0% /dev tmpfs 909M 9.8M 900M 2% /etc/hosts shm 63M 0 63M
0% /dev/shm tmpfs 909M 0 909M 0% /sys/fs/cgroup tmpfs 909M 0 909M 0%
/proc/acpi tmpfs 909M 0 909M 0% /proc/scsi tmpfs 909M 0 909M 0%
/sys/firmware tmpfs 909M 0 909M 0% /sys/fs/selinux tmpfs 909M 0 909M 0%
/sys/dev

....

You will notice that all of the filesystem contents are either memory-based (tmpfs, shm) or the overlay file associated with this runtime of the container image (overlay).

Switch to the `RHEL Host` tab. Use this terminal to verify that the container is running:

```bash
podman ps -a
....

*Note:* Your CONTAINER ID and NAMES will be different than the output
displayed above as each container is assigned a unique ID and Name.
